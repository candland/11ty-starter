    <p>Hi! I'm Dusty.</p>

    <p>I've always loved making things. Most of my life those things have been
    digital but making something physical has been in the back of my mind. This
    year I decided it's was finally time to jump in and do it.</p>

    <p>Skateboarding has made me who I am. Taught me you can't give up. That
    you have to keep pushing. And the only competition is yourself.</p>

    <p>I later found those same lessons hold true for Climbing and later
    Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And really everything.</p>

    <p>For this adventure, I'm making products that mix those cultures. I hope
    you enjoy them as much as I do!</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
